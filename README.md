## Introduction

The proposed solution is based on the problems that have been explained in the background of the problem, namely by making a translation application from movement to vocabulary and sentences. The input from the system is in the form of sign language movements, for the output is in the form of vocabulary or sentences from the sign language movements that have been carried out. The output issued is based on the results of the data that has been trained on Machine Learning, the processed data will go through the training and testing process which will then evaluate the results of the Machine Learning. The method used in using the CNN model. This application will be designed using the Kotlin, Python and server programming languages. Thus, the need based on the objectives carried out in this research is to design an Android-based application as a sign language translator that can have a high level of accuracy as a translator.
